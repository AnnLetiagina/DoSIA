# DoSIA - Downstream Sequence element Iterative Analyzer
This repository contains the code for running DoSIA, a model that can predict human genes expression level based on their Downstream Sequence Element (DSE) sequence.

The model was trained on >200 thousands randomized DSE poly-A signals expressed on mini gene reporters in HEK293T.

#### DoSIA requires the following packages to be installed
- Python >= 3.10
- Pycaret >= 3.0
- ViennaRNA >= 2.6
- scikit-learn >= 0.2.0
- xgboost >= 2.0
- Pandas >= 1.5
- Seaborn >= 0.12
